# PotatoLife : API based Potato Disease Classification 

PotatoLife is an automated project for farmers for timely and accurate diagnosis of diseases in potato leaves.

### INTRODUCTION
- Potato(Solanum tuberosum) is the fourth-most important staple crop in the world.   
- Potato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases.
- This project identifies and classifies major potato diseases.
- By accurately diagnosing diseases, farmers can apply targeted treatments, reducing the need for excessive pesticide use.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
- Potato crops are highly vulnerable to diseases, impacting yield and food security.
- Early, precise disease detection is crucial for efficient management and reduced crop loss.
- Traditional diagnosis methods are slow and unsuitable for large-scale agriculture.
- There's a need for automated, scalable solutions for disease detection.

### CONCLUSIONS/OUTCOMES
- Robust Data Preparation: Data preprocessing, involving batch loading, resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation, enhanced dataset quality and diversity.
- Model achieved an impressive 98.83% test accuracy, showcasing deep learning's effectiveness in disease classification.
- User-Friendly Implementation: FastAPI and Postman software facilitated user-friendly disease classification, empowering farmers and experts for on-the-spot diagnosis.
- Effectively address timely and accurate detection of potato leaf diseases.
